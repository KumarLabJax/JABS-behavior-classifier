# JABS IO (`jabs-io`)

This package defines the canonical data models and handles all 
serialization/deserialization logic.

## Overview

`jabs-io` decouples the JABS data representation from specific file formats or legacy
versions. It provides a unified way to interact with pose estimation data, behavioral
features, and annotations.
