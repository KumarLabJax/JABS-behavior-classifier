# JABS Docs

This directory contains JABS documentation that is not included as part of the jabs-behavior-classifier package itself. Any files here are intended to be viewed directly, rather than imported as modules. If you have documentation that should be part of the in-app help system, please add them to src/jabs/resources/docs instead. The user guide in this directory mostly links to those in-app docs so there is a single source of truth for User Guide documentation.
