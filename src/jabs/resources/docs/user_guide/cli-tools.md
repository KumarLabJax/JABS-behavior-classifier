# Command Line Tools

## jabs-classify

JABS includes a script called `jabs-classify`, which can be used to classify a single video from the command line.

```text
usage: jabs-classify COMMAND COMMAND_ARGS

commands:
 classify   classify a pose file
 train      train a classifier that can be used to classify multiple pose files

See `jabs-classify COMMAND --help` for information on a specific command.
```

### Classify Command

```text
usage: jabs-classify classify [-h] [--random-forest | --xgboost]
                            (--training TRAINING | --classifier CLASSIFIER) --input-pose
                            INPUT_POSE --out-dir OUT_DIR [--fps FPS]
                            [--feature-dir FEATURE_DIR]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --fps FPS             frames per second, default=30
  --feature-dir FEATURE_DIR
                        Feature cache dir. If present, look here for features before computing.
                        If features need to be computed, they will be saved here.

required arguments:
  --input-pose INPUT_POSE
                        input HDF5 pose file (v2, v3, or v4).
  --out-dir OUT_DIR     directory to store classification output

optionally override the classifier specified in the training file:
 Ignored if trained classifier passed with --classifier option.
 (the following options are mutually exclusive):
  --random-forest       Use Random Forest
  --xgboost             Use XGBoost

Classifier Input (one of the following is required):
  --training TRAINING   Training data h5 file exported from JABS
  --classifier CLASSIFIER
                        Classifier file produced from the `jabs-classify train` command
```

### Train Command

```text
usage: jabs-classify train [-h] [--random-forest | --xgboost]
                         training_file out_file

positional arguments:
  training_file        Training h5 file exported by JABS
  out_file             output filename

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit

optionally override the classifier specified in the training file:
 (the following options are mutually exclusive):
  --random-forest      Use Random Forest
  --xgboost            Use XGBoost
```

> Note: XGBoost may be unavailable on macOS if `libomp` isn't installed. See `jabs-classify classify --help` output for list of classifiers supported in the current execution environment.

> Note: fps parameter is used to specify the frames per second (used for scaling time unit for speed and velocity features from "per frame" to "per second").

## jabs-features

JABS includes a script called `jabs-features`, which can be used to generate a feature file for a single video from the command line.

```text
usage: jabs-features [-h] --pose-file POSE_FILE --pose-version POSE_VERSION
                            --feature-dir FEATURE_DIR [--use-cm-distances]
                            [--window-size WINDOW_SIZE] [--fps FPS]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pose-file POSE_FILE
                        pose file to compute features for
  --pose-version POSE_VERSION
                        pose version to calculate features
  --feature-dir FEATURE_DIR
                        directory to write output features
  --use-cm-distances    use cm distance units instead of pixel
  --window-size WINDOW_SIZE
                        window size for features (default none)
  --fps FPS             frames per second to use for feature calculation
```

## jabs-cli

`jabs-cli` is a command line interface that provides access to JABS utilities that did not warrant a full command line tool. To get a listing of current commands, run:

```bash
jabs-cli --help
```
