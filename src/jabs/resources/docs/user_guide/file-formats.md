# File Formats

This section documents the format of JABS output files that may be needed for downstream analysis.

## Prediction File

An inference file represents the predicted classes for each identity present in one video file.

### Location

The prediction files are saved in `<JABS project dir>/jabs/predictions/<video_name>.h5` if they were generated by the JABS GUI.

The `jabs-classify` script saves inference files in `<out-dir>/<video_name>_behavior.h5`

### Contents

The H5 file contains one group, called `predictions`. This group contains one or more behavior prediction groups. Each behavior prediction group contains 3 datasets and 1 new group.

```text
predictions/
  behavior_1/
    predicted_class
    probabilities
    identity_to_track
  behavior_2/
    ...
```

### Attributes

The root file contains the following attributes:

- pose_file: filename of the pose file used during prediction
- pose_hash: blake2b hash of pose file
- version: prediction output version

Each behavior prediction group contains the following attributes:

- classifier_file: filename of the classifier file used to predict
- classifier_hash: blake2b hash of the classifier file
- app_version: JABS application version used to make predictions
- prediction_date: date when predictions were made

### predicted_class

- dtype: 8-bit integer
- shape: #identities x #frames

This dataset contains the predicted class. Each element contains one of three values:

- 0: "not behavior"
- 1: "behavior"
- -1: "identity not present in frame".

### probabilities

- dtype: 32-bit floating point
- shape: #identities x #frames

This dataset contains the probability (0.0-1.0) of each prediction. If there is no prediction (the identity doesn't exist at a given frame) then the prediction probability is 0.0.

### identity_to_track

- dtype: 32-bit integer
- shape: #identities x #frames

This dataset maps each JABS-assigned identity (Pose version 3) back to the original track ID from the pose file at each frame. -1 indicates the identity does not map to a track for that frame. For Pose File Version 4 and greater, JABS uses the identity assignment contained in the pose file. For pose version 2, there will be exactly one identity (0).

## Feature File

A feature file represents features calculated by JABS for a single animal in a video file.

### Location

Feature files are saved per identity at `<JABS project dir>/jabs/features/<video_name>/<identity>/features.h5`.

### Contents

The H5 file contains feature data described in the [feature documentation](features.md). Features used in JABS classifiers are located within the `features` group, further separated by `per_frame` and `window_features_<window_size>` groups. Features not used in JABS classifiers are located outside the `features` group.

All features are a vector of data containing the feature value for each frame in the video.

The root file contains the following attributes:

- distance_scale_factor: scale factor used when converting from pixel space to cm space
- identity: identity value from the original pose value
- num_frames: number of frames in the video
- pose_hash: blake2b hash of pose file
- version: feature version used when generating this feature file

### Per-Frame Feature Names

Per frame features are named `<feature module> <feature name>`. Feature modules cannot contain spaces, while feature names can.

### Window Feature Names

Window features are named `<feature module> <window operation> <feature name>`. Feature modules and window operations cannot contain spaces, while feature names can.
