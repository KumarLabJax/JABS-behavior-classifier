# Choosing a Classifier Type

JABS supports three machine learning classifier types: **Random Forest**, **CatBoost**, and **XGBoost**. Each has different characteristics that may make it more suitable for your specific use case.

> **Classifier type vs. classifier mode:** This page covers the machine learning *algorithm*. Separately, JABS can train one binary classifier per behavior (the default) or a single classifier across all behaviors at once. See [Multi-Class Classification (Preview)](multi-class.md) for the experimental multi-class mode.

## Random Forest (Default)

Random Forest is the default classifier and a good starting point for most users.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Fast training** - Trains quickly, even on large datasets
- ✅ **Well-established** - Mature algorithm with extensive validation
- ✅ **Good baseline performance** - Reliable results across many behavior types
- ✅ **Low memory footprint** - Efficient with system resources

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **May plateau** - Sometimes reaches a performance ceiling compared to gradient boosting methods
- ⚠️ **Less flexible** - Fewer tuning options than boosting methods
- ⚠️ **Does not handle missing data** - Random Forest does not natively handle missing (NaN) values, so JABS currently replaces all NaNs with 0 during training and classification. This might not be a good choice if your data has many missing values

**Best for:** Quick iterations, initial exploration, behaviors with simpler decision boundaries, or when training time is a priority.

## CatBoost

CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that can achieve excellent performance, particularly for complex behaviors.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **High accuracy** - Often achieves the best classification performance
- ✅ **Handles missing data natively** - No imputation needed for NaN values
- ✅ **Robust to overfitting** - Built-in regularization techniques
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - Installs cleanly without additional libraries

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **Slower training** - Takes significantly longer to train than Random Forest
- ⚠️ **Higher memory usage** - May require more RAM during training
- ⚠️ **Longer to classify** - Prediction can be slower on very large datasets

**Best for:** Final production classifiers where accuracy is paramount, complex behaviors with subtle patterns, or when you have time for longer training sessions.

## XGBoost

XGBoost is another gradient boosting algorithm known for winning machine learning competitions.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Excellent performance** - Typically matches or exceeds Random Forest accuracy
- ✅ **Handles missing data natively** - Like CatBoost, works with NaN values
- ✅ **Faster than CatBoost** - Better training speed than CatBoost
- ✅ **Widely used** - Extensive community support and documentation

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **Dependency on libomp** - On macOS, may require separate installation of OpenMP library
- ⚠️ **Slower than Random Forest** - Training takes longer than Random Forest
- ⚠️ **May be unavailable** - If libomp is not installed, XGBoost won't be available as a choice in JABS

**Best for:** When you need better accuracy than Random Forest but faster training than CatBoost, or when you're familiar with gradient boosting methods.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Random Forest | CatBoost | XGBoost |
|---------|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Training Speed** | ⚡⚡⚡ Fast | 🐌 Slow | ⚡⚡ Moderate |
| **Accuracy** | ⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Good |
| **Missing Data Handling** | Imputation to 0 | Native support | Native support |
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Simple | ✅ Simple | ⚠️ May need libomp |
| **Best Use Case** | Quick iterations | Production accuracy | Balanced performance |

## Recommendations

**Getting Started:** Start with **Random Forest** to quickly iterate and establish a baseline. It trains fast, allowing you to experiment with different labeling strategies and window sizes.

**Optimizing Performance:** Once you've refined your labels and parameters, try **CatBoost** for a potential accuracy boost. The longer training time is worthwhile for your final classifier.

**Alternative:** If CatBoost is too slow or you want something between Random Forest and CatBoost, try **XGBoost** (if available on your system).

**Note:** The actual performance difference between classifiers varies by behavior type and dataset. We recommend testing multiple classifiers on your specific data to find the best option for your use case.
